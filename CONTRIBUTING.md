## Coding guidelines

We use flake8 for linting and black for automatic formatting.

```shell
make quality
```

## Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for commit messages.

## Commit Guidelines

Make atomic commits that represent a single, logical change. For example, when implementing a new feature:

- Separate implementation code from test code
- Keep documentation updates in their own commits
- Split large changes into smaller, focused commits that are easier to review

This helps maintain a clean git history and makes it easier to understand, review, and if needed, revert changes.
